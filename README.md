# Workout Tracker Application

This is a personal project, where the main goal is to create an application that can keep track of your workouts.

To do this, a login/signup feature was implemented, where Firebase was used to handle authentication of the user. 
For the front-end portion, React.js was used to create an interactive calendar, where the user can select the month and 
day. By selecting a particular day, the user can see what workouts were logged on that day, if any, and they are also given
the option to add a workout they have done during that day.

There is also a Workouts tab on the sidebar, which is used for the user's convenience to look at various workouts to see which ones
they should do or try out. Currently, this page is a work-in-progress.

**The app is functional, however there are a list of things that still need to be done:**
1. Finish the workouts list tab
2. Allow users to customize their dashboard and account settings
3. Add a chart to graph their activity
4. Make it beautiful
5. Eventually transfer the backend over to MongoDB


This application is built using React.js and Firebase.
